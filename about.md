# About OpenSmpp

The OpenSmpp API is an open source Java library implementing the SMPP (Short
Message Peer to Peer) protocol. It is based on the original
[Logica OpenSMPP API](http://opensmpp.logica.com/).

At the moment only SMPP version 3.4 is supported.

Support for SMPP used to be provided via the forums at smsforum.net (no longer
in existence); but since SMS Forum ceased operations at the end of 2007,
official support is no longer available.
